NLP with ESP32 (lolin_d32_pro) and Tensorflow Light on Arduino Platform
================================

This project is in initial state. Its the objective to use Machine Learning (Natural Language Processing) get the ES32 enabled to recognize my voice
and to distinguish the digits 0...9 (four in a sequence) to set the alarm of an e-Ink clock.

The CLION setup is based on

I am using Google Tensorflow Light API to run the inference on ESP32, while developing the model on an Ubuntu System.
The initial model set-up is based on the Google Micro_Speech example app that is part of the Tensforflow Example package.
